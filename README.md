# node-naive-bayes
Naive Bayes Classifiers are commonly used for things like spam filters although there are much better AI/ML solutions today this seemed pretty straightforward to me so I've tried it first.

# Why is this here?
I don't rly care about this so much. I was using it to explore an idea, but eventually decided to take the better route and try by learning tensorflow as much of the data processing already had to be done in python. So creating another microservice for machine learning stuff would be significantly more reasonable than adding ML components to the already existing service.
